# Hugging Face Chatbot with Tkinter

Hey to the CS Team!

I decided to use the Hugging Face Serverless Interface API and Tkinter for this project. The setup is super simple! All you need to do is run the following commands in your console to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install tkinter
pip install scrolledtext
pip install threading
pip install huggingface_hub
```

Quick Note:
The API token might expire depending on when you're checking this (lol). If that happens, feel free to give me a call, or you can create your own token by visiting the Hugging Face website. Once you have your own token, simply replace the expired one in the code with your new token.

I'm also including a demo video in this repo, so you can see how the code works in case you run into any issues.

PS: Just dont hear it with the sound on.

Have a great day!
